        <p>The Morris Jumel Mansion was built in 1765 in NYC. It was once a headquarters for George Washington during the American Revolution. Eliza Jumel bought the house in 1810 with her husband Stephen Jumel, a rich French merchant who sold wine. A year after her husband’s death caused by falling out of his carriage in 1832, Eliza married the third Vice President of the United States, Aaron Burr. The marriage was not a good one and they divorced in 1836. </p>
        <p>Due to its very long American history, it isn’t surprising to spot ghost sightings around the mansion. Legend has it that Eliza’s ghost still roams the mansion, with visitors reporting hearing strange noises, feeling sudden temperature drops, and even seeing apparitions of Eliza herself. Rumors suggested that Eliza might have been responsible for her husband's death. It was speculated that he bled to death as a result of her actions in removing his bandages, even though he was brought home after the fall and still showed signs of life. Currently, the mansion is open twice a month for ghost tours.</p>
