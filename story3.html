        <p>The New Amsterdam Theater in NYC is said to be haunted by the ghost of Olive Thomas, a Ziegfeld Follies dancer who died in 1920 under mysterious circumstances. The Ziegfield Follies were theatrical performers who influenced the shape of Broadway musicals. It’s believed that Thomas haunts the theater’s basement and dressing rooms, where she has been seen in her Follies costume. There have also been reports of strange noises, objects moving on their own, and unexplained cold spots. Some believe that the theater is also haunted by the ghost of a stagehand who fell to his death during construction, as well as the spirits of other performers who graced its stage in the early 20th century.
