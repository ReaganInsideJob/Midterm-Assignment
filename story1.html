        <p>Washington Square Park in New York City used to be a potter’s field and military training ground. Around 22,000 people died from yellow fever and were buried here. The bodies were not taken out of the ground, so to this day, they remain there beneath the pavement of the park. The reason a public square was created on top of the cemetery was because the mayor at that time Philip Hone wanted to raise the property value of the surrounding buildings. It proved successful when NYU brought the buildings between Waverly and Washington Place in 1832. 
</p>
        <p>There is a well-known tree in the square called “Hangman’s Elm” which is supposedly over 300 years old. Legend has it that during the American Revolution traitors were hung on that tree. The only confirmed execution was a slave named Rose Butler who was accused of arson. She was buried in the potter’s field.</p>
